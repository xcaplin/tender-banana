      "detailedDescription": "Summary:  We are looking to appoint an evaluation partner to review and support the Young Futures Panels Evaluation.   Specific Research Questions will include:   How, and to what extent, are the Young Futures Panels (YFP) continuing to meet their objectives?    How have the Young Futures Panels been implemented across different areas of West Yorkshire and what are the key enablers and barriers to effective delivery?   How has the learning from the pilot stage been used to shape and refine YFP implementation and what are the advantages and disadvantages of this in West Yorkshire?    The proposed evaluation objectives include:   Examine the continued delivery of the YFP identifying areas of good practice and opportunities for further improvement and adaption.   Review each areas' theory of change to ensure they reflect current delivery.    Review all processes involved in the delivery of the YFP in each area, offering partners constructive recommendations for efficiency and supporting them to embed delivery as part of business as usual.   Examine the onward referral processes into local services, identify areas of improvement and support Panel members to implement recommendations.    Ensure that the perceptions of both young people in receipt of Panel support and professionals involved in the Panels are captured sufficiently to identify feedback loops and further ideas on improvement while gauging their general response to the process.    Support Panel members and the VRP to continually improve monitoring materials to support effective performance monitoring and impact evaluations.    Pilot and review how an impact evaluation could best be designed to capture the impact of Panels on intended outcomes and any other potential outcomes.    Provide detailed recommendations and an evaluation framework for the optimal design of an impact evaluation.   Develop implementation guidance to support the onboarding of other areas to develop and implement a YFP.",
