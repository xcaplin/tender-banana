There is a possibility that during the life of the proposed contract that the size of HM Naval Fleet may increase or decrease. The support contract took the form of a Framework arrangement and has been awarded under DSPCR 2011 regulations. Call-Off contracts were awarded to 16 suppliers via call-off competitions. Mini-Competitions are held throughout the life of the framework agreement. This mini-competition was for the provision of Marine Electrical Power items. The awarded call-off contract value was determined subsequent to a competitive exercise undertaken in accordance with the framework terms. The overall framework contract runs to 31 March 2031 and has a maximum value of £317m.The call-off contract value is withheld due to commercial sensitivities and the ongoing competitive nature of the Framework.",

This phase of work is introducing UPS Systems (consisting of Inverter and Lithium Ion Batteries) to support Operational Technology, with the aim of providing an average of 6 hours resilience against Power Outages. As UPS Systems were not included within the original design of Smart Motorways, the CMDB and DMRB/MCHW will need to be updated to include the option of UPS to support the power supply where it is deemed appropriate. Furthermore, a new product specification is required for the Cabinets to house the new UPS Inverters, Batteries and ancillary equipment. This Work Order aims to onboard a service provider to make the relevant document updates, drive these through governance to final approval and contribute to the strategic decisions from a Safety and Engineering Standards perspective that are required to deliver the project.",
