A review of the mine water block by the Coal Authority has highlighted that mine water levels in the area could be elevated in respect to the rest of the block. There is potential for elevated mine water levels which could pose a risk to the overlying drinking water aquifers. Therefore, the Coal Authority requires construction of a borehole to intersect flooded underground workings at the former Priestner's Colliery at Westleigh, Wigan. The proposed borehole is to be used to improve understanding of mine water in the Golborne, Bickershaw and Parsonage mine water block and will be used for water level monitoring, water quality sampling and abstraction of water.",

      "detailedDescription": "Birmingham City Council has a statutory duty to maintain its public highways, parks, and open spaces to a high standard of cleanliness and safety. To fulfil this obligation, the Council relies heavily on a skilled manual workforce equipped with a wide range of hand tools, power tools, garden tools, and associated ancillaries. These tools are essential for the day-to-day operations carried out across multiple depots, each of which operates its own stores and budgetary controls. Historically, the procurement of tools and equipment has been managed on an ad hoc basis, with quotations sought from multiple suppliers to achieve best value. However, this approach has presented challenges in consistency, delivery times, and administrative efficiency. In response, the Council initiated a formal procurement process to establish a single-source call-off contract under the NEPO219 Building Materials Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS). This route was selected following an options appraisal which identified the DPS as the most suitable framework to ensure compliance with the Procurement Act 2023 and, provided access to the numerous incumbent providers to join the DPS and compete for the Council's business.",

The Power, Propulsion and Auxiliaies (PPA) Team, which is part of the ships operating centre within Defence Equipment Support (DES) provides global support to the Royal Navy. PPA has set up a Framework agreement to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul to Royal Naval Platforms through an established set of suppliers. There is a possibility that during the life of the proposed contract that the size of HM Naval Fleet may increase or decrease. The support contract took the form of a Framework arrangement and has been awarded under DSPCR 2011 regulations. Call-Off contracts were awarded to 16 suppliers via call-off competitions. Mini-Competitions are held throughout the life of the framework agreement. This mini-competition was for the provision of mechanical systems items. The awarded call-off contract value was determined subsequent to a competitive exercise undertaken in accordance with the framework terms. The overall framework contract runs to 31 March 2031 and has a maximum value of £317m.The call-off contract value is withheld due to commercial sensitivities and the ongoing competitive nature of the Framework.",

Mini-Competitions are held throughout the life of the framework agreement. This mini-competition was for the provision of Marine Electrical Power items. The awarded call-off contract value was determined subsequent to a competitive exercise undertaken in accordance with the framework terms. The overall framework contract runs to 31 March 2031 and has a maximum value of £317m.The call-off contract value is withheld due to commercial sensitivities and the ongoing competitive nature of the Framework.",

This phase of work is introducing UPS Systems (consisting of Inverter and Lithium Ion Batteries) to support Operational Technology, with the aim of providing an average of 6 hours resilience against Power Outages. As UPS Systems were not included within the original design of Smart Motorways, the CMDB and DMRB/MCHW will need to be updated to include the option of UPS to support the power supply where it is deemed appropriate. Furthermore, a new product specification is required for the Cabinets to house the new UPS Inverters, Batteries and ancillary equipment.
